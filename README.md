# cc-website

To install or update the website, make sure that composer is installed:

`$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`

Then run either the `install` or `update` option from composer:

```
$ php composer.phar install
$ php composer.phar update
```

## Todo list

* Download a new fabric-themed background texture
* Add muted-autoplay to the promo video
* Remove banner-image.jpg if unused
* Use a larger CC logo image in the header
* Make inactive nav-links greyed out
* Make header/footer borders lighter grey
* Banner image idea: group pic, photoshopped as a sketch overlayed on background
* Set a default background color in case background image isn't loaded
* Make larger clicking areas for nav
* Add social media buttons? Contact info button?
