Since October 2009, the members of Ça Claque! have been promoting and celebrating French-Canadian folklore.

Ça Claque! fuses the energy and creativity of their talented musicians with the elegance and technique of their gifted dancers and offers audiences world-class entertainment that will keep you captivated from the first note of the fiddle to the last step of the jig.

After having refined their talents over the years within various folk groups all over the province of Manitoba, the members of Ça Claque! joined forces in order to reach beyond established folk traditions and present a repertoire peppered with contemporary components. Their goal is to keep their French-Canadian culture alive at home and abroad.

Since its inception in October 2009, Ça Claque! has recorded a 4 track demo CD and a 12 track full-length CD.

The group has represented Canada internationally in Costa Rica, Peru and Chile and has participated in countless local, national and international festivals.

Ça Claque! is a member of Folklorama Talent and is a featured guest at CIOFF (International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Arts) festivals.
